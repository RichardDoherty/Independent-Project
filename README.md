# Independent-Project
These are projects that I have developed and am continuing to develop outside of school.
So far the projects I have completed are:

Audio Analysis GUI in Python with Tkinter: This GUI performs a Fast Fourier Transform on audio data from two .wav files and compares their frequency distributions using non-parametric hypothesis testing. This program is used to compare the audio output of two different turntable styli. I created this program to aid the company I worked with during my senior design project in quality control for the styli that we helped them develop.  

C++ Cluster analysis: This program runs a cluster analysis on a series of points imported from a .txt file. Each data point and their cluster assignment are then output to the command line. This program was the first data mining technique I taught myself. I chose to work in C++ as oppose to Python because of its computation speed.
